scientific mystery long list everyday thing science figure plenty unusual mystery scientist scratch head field range meteorology medicine adapt episode list show youtube april teenager croatia woke mysterious hour coma much family relief strange thing happen year old girl speak parent native croatian still able understand language could respond inexplicably fluent german language begin study school require translator able communicate family doctor remain stump case mysterious croatian german language swap example brain injury lead unexplainable language phenomenon australian man woke car crash speak perfect mandarin teenager atlanta woke coma speak fluent spanish trouble speak native english would seizure every time try doctor scientist fully explain event role language development brain dynamic field scientist generally presume important example knowledge new language still unknown phenomenon affect certain people drastically june massive explosion decimate forest siberia near podkamennaya tunguska river fireball believe meter wide erupt sky flatten million tree kill hundred reindeer intense resident near town mile away felt heat explosion one eyewitness recount sky split two high forest whole northern part sky appear cover fire moment band sky mighty crash crash follow noise like stone fall sky gun fire explosion come know tunguska event say produce time energy atomic bomb drop hiroshima event size intensity would expect source pretty obvious hundred year later scientist still figure cause common explanation time sort meteoroid impact crater little evidence kind extraterrestrial object surround area scientist later conclude comet enter atmosphere comet largely make ice therefore left behind obvious rock fragment expedition area found promising globule point toward meteoritic origin might put tunguska mystery rest scientist still convince paper suggest black hole collide earth lead massive explosion quickly dispute study seem imply event indeed kind meteoric explosion truly definitive conclusion yet found theory ufo crash nuclear explosion still persist tunguska event mysterious thing happen siberia another unexplainable thing hidden among tree irkutsk region patom crater otherwise know fire eagle nest large rock formation southeastern siberia crater foot diameter foot height ring shape crown discover geologist name vadim kolpakov probably year old region home yakut turkic group habit area generation accord yakut legend crater evil place even deer dare go near kolpakov discover note distance look like mine shaft slagheap whitish even thought people labor camp area unless secret one accord tomsk science center help google translate add would sent geo prospect area contrary would offer stay away second thought archaeological artifact local evenk yakut respect ancient egyptian could build stone pyramid human resource necessary scientific knowledge unlike tunguska event scientist initially try explain crater result sort extraterrestrial impact however think might result natural gas bursting surface earth much speculation formation geologic world entire conference dedicate appropriately call patom crater conference conference participant reach consensus estimation patom crater result meteorite suggest create sort geological process time explanation still educate guess scientist want study new drug often test comparison placebo sugar pill minimum drug need produce well result control placebo consider effective strangely though placebo often produce change test subject even though physiological mechanism account change real measurable impact essentially fake treatment know placebo effect idea placebo effect around since least th century scientist fully understand know brain perform complex neurobiological reaction expect result like release endorphin dopamine believe receive antidepressant mean know researcher harvard study negative positive effect placebo effect consider holistic experience professor ted kaptchuk describes like look study compare drug placebo entire environmental ritual factor work go clinic certain time examine medical professional white coat receive kind exotic pill undergo strange procedure profound impact body perceives symptom feel get attention care still explain placebo effect always work effective certain people situation one brain many unique confuse trait point feel like specie pretty decent understand weather cause predict talk fail first date one weather phenomenon escape understand however morning glory cloud mesmerize meteorological occurrence look like something fantasy novel report wild look roll cloud around world reliable morning glory cloud almost solely spot near burketown australia specific circumstance take form stretch mile length tourist reportedly flock burketown october try spot include fair number hang glider attempt fly unique cloud scientist still really understand morning glory cloud come basic understand specific humidity level sea breeze pattern mesoscale circulation generally precede morning glory cloud distinct nearly unique one australian peninsula still understood possibly one willing adequately fund research visually arrest necessarily scientifically important cloud july mary reeser landlord stop apartment come upon horrify scene reeser char remains left intact part one foot still encase slipper curiously room almost completely unburnt fbi investigate conclude mary take sleep pill previous even reporting could become drowsy fall asleep smoking cigarette thus ignite clothes accord report body fat fed flame many skeptic seem realistic fire hot could cause minimal damage reeser apartment cremation often require temperature well degree spontaneous human combustion seem plausible explanation doubt even lead one professor university pennsylvania theorize someone murder mary incinerate remains crematorium brought back apartment someone find day one explain really happen world unexplainable phenomenon whole category mysterious sound come outer space remote part wilderness especially eerie one depth ocean one sound upsweep sound upsweep around since least pacific marine environmental laboratory begin record sosus underwater soviet surveillance system multiple listen station around world sound consists long train narrow band upsweeping sound several second duration
