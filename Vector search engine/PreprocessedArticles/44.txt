frostbite finger really fine detailed work like splice wire try like close cap back little screw something like take minute troubleshoot solve pain worth glaciologists like liam lead well understand ice sheet mass balance measure much mass ice sheet accumulate snowfall much lose melt iceberg break liam colgan idea get handle mass balance input output time space understand ice sheet health change time space today least recent year look climate projection un talk look different climate pathway try say hey ice sheet health go pathway base knowledge process today kat long health today look liam colgan ice sheet state persistent decline poor health today negative mass balance mean output meltwater runoff iceberg calve output much great input climate warms direct effect much ice sheet melt remember million titanics worth ice lose year mention begin story liam colgan equivalent eight metric ton per second also almost inconceivably large number maybe also help contextualize think thousand ton mass loss per second annual average day day around clock around year actually change gravity essentially greenland loses ice becomes lighter mean exert less gravitational pull hold ocean water close water release slosh around earth collect elsewhere meaning place thousand kilometer away affected melt ice place nearer pole another mind boggling effect greenland loss ice call post glacial rebound millennium greenland land press weight ice sheet ice sheet melt get lighter land spring upward monitoring station near fast move jakobshavn glacier bedrock foot high sea level time average
