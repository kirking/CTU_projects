involve direct observation earth core impossible geologist make inference dr ken rubin professor department earth science university hawaii address precisely question website ask earth scientist dr rubin explanation provide u cool earth fact first say know overall density mass earth base measurement earth perturbs orbit planet moon basically put earth scale get mass use understand gravity come pretty good estimate hat tip isaac newton law gravity henry cavendish determine universal gravitational constant earth mass roughly sextillion metric tonne volume around trillion cubic kilometer sound

meteorite thought essentially unchanged since formation begin solar system rubin explains look information like create essentially balance sheet material element found earth observe chemical element crust mantle process elimination geologist reason element must found core additionally existence earth magnetic field tell u must high concentration metal earth core specifically metal remain liquid even high pressure available evidence common sense inference allow u assume earth core primarily iron small amount nickel alongside lighter element oxygen sulfur interest fact earth magnetic field flip could stand location face direction hundred thousand year apart compass would actually tell face north one time south another fact geologic evidence suggests polarity reversal occur last million

though note earth plasticity much much less silicone plastic clay familiar child less perfectly spherical shape earth mean stand sea level actually closer center earth pole compare equator kilometer closer fact great distance center mass two object low gravitational force object alongside force bulge planet mean force gravity object generally great earth pole equator actually weigh teeny bit less ecuador would antarctica worth point mass would stay refer specifically weight basically way say force gravity object factor come play though high altitude bring farther center earth weight decrease little bit high fly airplane example altitude gain mountain complicate relationship gravity yes altitude brings farther center earth mountain provide additional source gravity density earth crust give location play role weight mountaintop otherwise gravity actually varies across planet number reason one big variation observe canada hudson bay region average resident weighs tenth ounce less would area typical gravitational force grace joint research project nasa german aerospace center offer explanation relative paucity gravity hudson bay identify two contribute factor ten thousand year ago giant ice sheet cover area depress earth crust force mass away depression mean less mass underneath hudson bay therefore less gravitational force additionally convection kilometer beneath surface earth likely play role thought convection current drag continent low gravitational force area grace researcher estimate impact ice sheet could account percent drop gravity hudson bay rest attributable convection current tectonic movement constant quite slow movement tectonic plate far range effect planet give rise entire island like hawaii actually series volcano plate tectonics also cause
